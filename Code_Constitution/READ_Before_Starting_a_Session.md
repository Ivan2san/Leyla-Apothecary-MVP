You are about to work on the Leyla's Apothecary codebase. Before making ANY changes, you MUST read and follow the project's governance files.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: Your FIRST action must be:
1. Read: .claude/PROJECT_RULES.md
2. Read: .claude/FORBIDDEN_CHANGES.md  
3. Read: .claude/COMMON_FIXES.md
4. Read: .claude/TEST_REQUIREMENTS.md

After reading, confirm you understand by listing:
1. The 5 things you must NEVER change
2. The test command you'll run before committing
3. The git branch naming convention to use

Only proceed with fixes after this confirmation.
